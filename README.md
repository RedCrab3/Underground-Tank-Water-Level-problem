# Underground-Tank-Water-Level-problem
There are several real-time problems that I found in my locality and in my house itself. Some of them are the underground water tank and pump problem, automatic sanitizing of amazon (or other E-commerce services) delivered products, automatic smart street lighting, and so on. All of these problems in my locality can be solved using IoT, but being a kind of village area under Panchayat and with less development, they have not been implemented. I found the first Underground water tank problem quite interesting to solve. It is a very common problem in almost all of our homes where the water pump needs to be manually switched off when the tank is full of water. Without a proper system to inform when the tank is full, this timing has to be mainly guessed. People, like my family, mainly do this by daily experience on how much time it takes the water pump to fill the underground water tank, half an hour, an hour, etc. Many times, people guess the wrong time and either switch the pump off too early, before the tank is full of water, leading to a shortage of water for daily use. Otherwise, it’s too late leading to water overflowing from the tank. In fact, sometimes people forget to switch the pump off too which leads to excessive overflow of water outside of the house, into the streets. This leads to wastage of precious water and dirtying of the surroundings of the house. Either way, it’s a real-time problem that persists in many houses, mine being one of them. This simple yet troublesome problem can be easily solved using IoT technology and sensors.
